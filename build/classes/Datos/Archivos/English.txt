The mechanics are as follows: Select a sphere with a value and 
through a trace that can be in any sense, you look for an 
adjacent sphere of the same value, and these add up. If after 
the merger, the second sphere has another adjacent sphere that
be of the value resulting from the two previously selected, 
they could also be merged, and so on.
Can you add all the numbers in this challenging game of wit?
Move the balls or numbered spheres to make them merge. 
How many movements will you be able to make Until you get it?
We appreciate the challenge
